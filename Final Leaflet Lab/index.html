                <ul> <!--this creates a bullet point list-->
                    <li>What is an "eight thousander"? They are the 14 mountains in the world that are more than 8,000 metres. They are located in Asia in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges.  </li>
                    &nbsp <!--creates a space between the bullets for easier reading. Nobody wants a wall of words-->
                    <li>Historically, the difficulty and conditions associated with climbing mountains leads to fatalities.</li>
                    &nbsp
                    <li>During the time frame displayed on this map, a total of 111 people died while climbing one of the "eight thousanders". The most deaths for the "eight-thousanders" in this time period were recorded in Mount Everest, with a total of 49 fatalities.  </li>
                    &nbsp
                    <li>The most common cause of death on Mount Everest is from avalanches. The event with the most fatalities occured in 2015, in which 15 people died in the Base Camp avalanche following the April 2015 Nepal earthquake.</li>
                    &nbsp

            <h2 class="scroll-page scroll-page-2">Analysis:
                <ul>
                    <li>The only non-"eight-thousander" mountain included on this map, Mount Rainier (4,392m), actually experienced the second most fatalities during this time period with a total of 10 deaths. Mount Rainier is located in the northwestern portion of the United States. </li>
                    &nbsp
                    <li>Fatalities are likely correlated to number of visitors. Mount Rainier recieves around 10,000 climbers each year whereas Mount Everest, the most popular of the "eight-thousanders", recieves 700 to 800 climbers each year. </li>
                    &nbsp
                    <li>During this time period, climbers of Mount Everest had a 6.5% chance of dying. In comparison, climbers of Mount Rainier had a .1% chance of dying during this time period.</li>
